    Sam Smith, in full Samuel Frederick Smith, (born May 19, 1992, London, England), British soul singer who was noted for his mellifluous voice and for the subject matter of his lyrics, some of which subverted the notions of romantic love that defined popular soul music.

    Smith was raised in Cambridgeshire. His father was a truck driver and greengrocer and his mother a banker. He began singing at a young age, encouraged by his parents after he impressed them with his rendition of Whitney Houston’s “My Love Is Your Love.” Smith pursued vocal training and soon appeared in local theatre productions and with Youth Music Theatre UK. He went through six managers before ultimately moving to London at age 18 to pursue opportunities there.

      Smith’s first big break came when he teamed with house duo Disclosure on the track “Latch,” which featured his liquid falsetto vocals astride an effervescent electronic beat. That recording was released in 2012 and emerged as a hit. The collaboration landed Smith a record deal. By early 2013 he had released “Lay Me Down,” the first single from his debut album, In the Lonely Hour. His vocals were also featured on the propulsive electronica track “La La La” (2013), by producer Naughty Boy. The breakout single from In the Lonely Hour, “Stay with Me,” a keening falsetto ballad that wistfully implores a one-night stand for affection, became a radio staple following its release in 2014. Smith cited the influences of singers such as Houston and Aretha Franklin in shaping his sound. Both propelled their powerful, soaring voices to the high end of their registers as they evoked love and loss. Those themes defined In the Lonely Hour, an album that Smith, who was homosexual, had composed in the wake of a romantic rejection by a heterosexual man.

      The young vocalist steadily accrued accolades for his dulcet stylings, earning comparisons to crooners ranging from Frank Sinatra to Adele. At the 2015 Grammy Awards, In the Lonely Hour was named best pop vocal album, and “Stay with Me” was awarded record of the year and song of the year. Smith was deemed best new artist. The revelation in early 2015 that the singer had settled out of court with singer Tom Petty over melodic similarities between “Stay with Me” and Petty’s 1989 single “I Won’t Back Down” was tempered by a statement from the rocker expressing goodwill toward Smith and praising the quickness with which the situation was corrected. Also in 2015 Smith sang “Writing’s on the Wall,” which he wrote with Jimmy Napes, for the James Bond film Spectre; the duo later won an Academy Award for best original song. Smith’s second studio album, The Thrill of It All, was released in late 2017 and won both popular and critical praise. The song “Him,” a plea for acceptance of his love for a man, was especially acclaimed.
